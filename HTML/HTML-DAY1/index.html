div tag stands for division tag, it  is a block level element means restricted to take whole width of the screen.

span tag is inline level element which takes space that is required for it.

<span>Hello</span>
<span>Hello</span>
<span>World</span>

<!-- Class and IDs -->

<!-- In HTML, the only diffrence between class and ID is that id is unique and each element 
  can only have one ID, on the otherhand class are not unique we can use same class on multiple-element.
In CSS, Class is represented by '.' and ids can be represented by '#'.

manner, just to change the voice of tone.
